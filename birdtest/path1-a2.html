			<strong>The Red-tailed Hawk is a diurnal (active in the daytime) bird with incredile bravery when it comes to hunting and protecting their nests. The Red-tailed Hawk has a grip strength of 200 pounds per square inch that it uses to its advantage when hunting prey. This hawk will also defend its nest and offspring against anyone/anything that threatens it (including other hawks, eagles and even Great Horned owls). Despite being known as a violent predator, this hawk actually has a very peaceful and friendly side. Just like the Red-tailed Hawk, your defining characteristics are your bravery, friendliness and your prefrence of waking up earlier rather than later in the day. </strong>
